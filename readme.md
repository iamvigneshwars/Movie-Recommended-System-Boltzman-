# Movie Recommendation System 

This is a simple movie recommendation system which predicts if the user will like the movie.

## Algorithm Used

Boltzman Machines is used in this project

## Data Preprocessing 

	- Movies.dat contains list of movies, movie id's and the genre
	- Data in movies.dat are seperated by :: so it should be mentioned while importing
	- movies.dat does not have any header, so header should be set to None
	- movies.dat may contain some special characters so latin-1 encoding is used
